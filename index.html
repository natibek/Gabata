						<p class="abstract_text">
							Gabata (ገበጣ in Amharic) is the Ethiopian variation of Mancala.
							This traditional board game is commonly played using pits dug into
							the earth or carved into wooden surfaces. Each game involves two
							players, each with six pits, initially filled with four marbles,
							and a single empty deposit slot. The game unfolds as players
							carefully strategize their moves in an engaging competition of
							skill and foresight.
						</p>
						<p class="abstract_text">
							The primary objective is to outmaneuver one's opponent and
							accumulate a greater number of seeds or marbles in your own
							deposit slot. As marbles traverse the board, players must
							calculate and strategize to achieve favorable positions that will
							lead to capturing the opponent's marbles and ensuring their own
							success.
						</p>
						<p class="abstract_text">
							Despite experiencing a decline in popularity over the years,
							Gabata remains a captivating pursuit due to its strategic depth
							and mathematical underpinnings. The intricate dance of moving
							marbles, the suspenseful timing of capturing opponents' pieces,
							and the ultimate quest for a surplus of marbles in one's own
							deposit slot contributes to the enduring allure of this traditional
							Ethiopian game.
						</p>
						<p class="abstract_text">
							Now, you can experience the allure of this captivating game in a
							digital realm. Embrace the convenience of playing Gabata on your
							computer, either challenging a friend or engaging with bots
							programmed at varying levels of difficulty. This modern adaptation
							brings the essence of the traditional game to your screen,
							promising hours of strategic entertainment.

							To start, players gather all the marbles from one of their pits
							and, adhering to the counterclockwise direction, meticulously
							distribute them one by one into successive slots. Notably, players
							never place marbles into their opponent's deposit slot. The
							precision and anticipation that accompany each move are crucial,
							as the game's rules prescribe the precise moment when a player's
							turn concludes.
