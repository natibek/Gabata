					<br />

					<p>
						To start, each player has 6 pits with 4 marbles each and an empty
						deposit slot. The deposit slot for Player 1 is on the right side of
						the board and on the left for Player 2. To make a move, players
						gather all the marbles from one of their valid/playable pits and
						distribute them counterclockwise, one by one, into successive slots,
						<em>always skipping the opponent's deposit slot</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						A pit is valid/playable if it is on the player's side and not empty.
						They can be distinguished by their color when hovered over.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>The player's turn is over if:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>They land in an empty pit on the opponent's side.</li>
						<li>
							They land in an empty pit on their side and the symmetrically
							opposite opponent pit is empty.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>It is still the player's turn if:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>They land in their own deposit slot.</li>
						<li>
							They land in an empty pit on their side and the symmetrically
							opposite opponent pit is not empty. In this case, take the marble
							from your pit into the symmetrically oppoosite pit, collect all of
							them, and continue counterclockwise like regular.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The color of the player labels show whose turn it is.</p>
					<br />

					<p>
						The player with the most marbles in their deposit slot once no
						marbles are in the pits wins. Ties are possible when each player has
						24 marbles in their deposit slots.
					</p>

				<div id="bot" class="bot">
					<h2 class="sec_title">Bot</h2>
					<br />

					<p>
						The Gabata Bot looks at all the possible next
						<em>n levels</em> moves and chooses the one which resulted in the
						most amount of marbles in the deposit slot. An alternative strategy
						that could be imployed in future versions is choosing the moves that
						also lead to less changes in turns to the opponent.
					</p>

					<p>
						You can choose the strength of the bot by setting the bot level to
						-1 or a value from 1 to 8. Levels 1 to 8 are the smart bots that
						make the best move at the chosen depth. Bot level -1 looks at all
						the possible next 5 moves and chooses the one resulting in the least
						amount of marbles in the bot's deposit slot. It is difficult to lose
						to this bot.
					</p>

					<div class="demo">
						<img class="demo-img" src="Web Files/Bot Level.png" />
					</div>

					<p>
						You can choose whether you are Player 1 or 2 when playing against
						the bot. You can change this mid game as well.
					</p>

					<div class="demo">
						<img class="side" src="Web Files/Choose Side.png" />
					</div>
					<p>
						You can reset the bot level at any point in the game. Also, you can
						switch sides with the bot at any point in the game (saves you from
						looking terrible).
					</p>

							class="big"
							src="Web Files/Switch sides and Change level.mp4"
							id="demo1"
							autoplay
							muted
							loop
							width="70%"
						></video>
					</div>
					<p>
						You can also choose whether the bot makes the moves by itself
						whenever it's its turn by choosing the <em>Bot Automove</em> option
						under the Bot Settings. This is the default setting. Alternatively,
						you can have the bot highlight the move it wants to make and wait
						for you to make the move (convenient for cheating in the real world)
						by choosing the <em>Player Makes Bot Move</em> option.
					</p>

					<br />
					<p>
						Whenever you hover over a pit (unless it is on the bot's side), it
						switches colors to show whether you can start a move the pit or not.
						It turns lighter when valid and purple when invalid.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hovering over a valid pit or any of the deposit slots shows the
						number of marbles in the pit or deposit slot in the bottom display.
